This report presents a new and more rigorous way to define STEM occupations. The foundation
for this research is a data collection project sponsored by the Department of Labor called O*NET
(Occupational Information Network Data Collection Program), which uses detailed surveys of workers
in every occupation to thoroughly document their job characteristics and knowledge requirements.
Combining knowledge requirements for each occupation with other public databases, this report
presents a new portrait of the STEM economy. The approach used here does not seek to classify
occupations based on what workers do—such as research, mathematical modeling, or programming—
but rather what workers need to know to perform their jobs.
